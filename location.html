                        East Pennsboro Township has 13 parks, but my favorite by far is Adam's Ricci Park.  It has 82 acres of ball fields, trails and rentable pavilions for an awesome day with the kids! ðŸ™Œ

                        Right next to the town of Summerdale is <a href="https://www.centralpenn.edu/">Central Penn College</a>, which has great seasonal activities for both students and community.

                        My wife and I get takeout nearly once a week from Al's Pizza in the Summerdale Plaza about 5 minutes from where we live.  We love the salads there, but from time to time who doesn't like a good stromboli?
