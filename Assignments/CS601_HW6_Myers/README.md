## CS-601 - Edward Myers <br> Web Application Design

### Programs Used:
-   Visual Studio Code - MIT License

### Instructions:
-   All files must stay together in the file directory found in the CS601_HW6_Myers.zip file.  The primary launch page is intended to be index.html.
-   Interactions with the page include clicking on the clear button, hovering over images and clicking on images.

## Assignment #6 (JavaScript & Vue) 12/08/2023
Create HTML, CSS and JavaScript which uses Vue app component and syntax to create four pictures and have them change on mouseover. Add other functionality to demonstrate understanding of Vue.

### Features:
-   All pages have been passed through W3C and CSS validation without errors
-   JavaScript does not lint due to having Vue components.  Everything works without browser JS errors.
-   Four pictures are used, which have a default source which changes with mouseover per each picture.   

### Above & Beyond
-   The page is extensively CSS styled across all tags, and keyframe animations are used for picture effects and flytext.
-   Additional to the base requirements are:
    -   clear button created with Vue syntax with @click function call.
    -   form and textarea built using Vue syntax.  
    -   images created using v-for and use proper ES6 figure tags, figcaptions, alt and default sizing.
    -   figcaptions update using inline if statements to reflect which picture is displayed depending on mouseover status.
    -   images respond to @click actions, updating stat counters.
    -   fieldset legend and text area updates with text output of last image clicked.
    -   stat counters exist for overall click and hover counts.
    -   after interacting (click + hover) a total of 10 times, a p-tag flytext appears using v-if.

Thank you for your time, I hope you enjoy my submission.
