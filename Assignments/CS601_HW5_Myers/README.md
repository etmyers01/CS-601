## CS-601 - Edward Myers <br> Web Application Design

### Programs Used:
-   Visual Studio Code - MIT License

### Instructions:
-   All files must stay together in the file directory found in the CS601_HW4_Myers.zip file.  The primary launch page is intended to be index.html.
-   From the beginning, the submit button is disabled.  The user must provide input in compliance with the error readouts across all fields for the submit button to enable.

## Assignment #5 (JavaScript & JSON) 11/30/2023
Create and lint a JSON file with college degree data, then host it for retrieval and table rendering in an HTML document.  Use JavaScript to acquire the JSON with fetch and procedurally generate a table for insertion into the HTML page.

### Features:
-   All pages have been passed through W3C and CSS validation without errors
-   JSON file was validated through jsonlint.com
-   The contents of the JSON file are acquired via fetch, with an error catch that outputs errors to the HTML textarea display.  

### Above & Beyond
-   The webpage has an input field where the user can enter an alternative hosted .json file other than what was intended.  The default is prefilled.
-   The stages of fetch, response, data values and error catching are displayed within a non-editable textarea, equipped with scroll bar for repeated actions akin to a log file.
-   In addition to the submit button, a clear button is included to clear the contents of the textarea 'log' to start fresh.  This clear button also clears the procedural html table generated from any previous successes.  
-   The table, fieldsets and containers are CSS styled for scaling and use across wide screen and mobile platforms.
