                    My oldest son <b>Lucas</b> is four years old. His interests include Spiderman, Chinese food and
                    singing along to the soundtrack many different Disney movies.

                    My youngest son <b>Liam</b> just came into the world two months ago. I am currently at home for a
                    few weeks of hybrid paternity leave / remote work to take care of him. His interests include
                    sleeping, drinking formula and smiling at his mommy!

                <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    I love to spend time playing with my sons at the local park and taking them to see the animals at
                    the local farm market. My wife and I are avid gamers, so when we get some free time we like to play
                    Elder Scrolls Online and team up. I like the occasional bit of landscaping, building walls and
                    patios with paver block. Lastly, I'm an amateur artist and like to do pencil art of still pictures
                    or portraits.
