### Above & Beyond (across versions)

#### From Version 2
-   Multiple types of fonts were used across headers and paragraphs to give visual interest.
    -   A custom font ('satisfy') was taken from 1001fonts with free license and run through a font format generator at fontsquirrel.com.  The fonts are imported upon page load to style the section and table headers.  Several san-serif fonts are supplied as a failback.
-   The page body and all sub-content are set to max 960px for full width viewing.  The page uses table display with auto margins to achieve a constantly centered look despite the window width.
-   @keyframe amnimations were used to simulate slide in left and right effects for h2 and h3 headers.
-   Top navigation and header is positioned as fixed with use of z-index to create a static menu when scrolling.
-   Menu buttons are dynamically positioned, moving from flex inline to block grid to flex column as the viewable area contracts.
-   Menu buttons also have highlight styling on active page and on hover using pseudo class keys.  
-   Main page title uses a flexible width between certain breakpoints by using a calculation of minimum 12pt font while adding a view width multiplier for scaling.
-   Gallery page uses flexbox to reorganize pictures in a self-sorted double column.  This collapses to a single column upon screen shrink.
-   At screen breakpoints, numerous page attributes are affected:
    -   font size increases 
    -   images remove margins, auto-size down to 360px minimum
    -   headers become centered instead of left-justified
-   For print mode: several display changes are made:
    -   fonts converted to serif
    -   header and footer removed to move article content upward
    -   picture size is reduced to 500px to be less dominant on page
    -   article content is maximized to 100% of the page
    -   print margins are created at 2cm on all sides
    -   full link text is inserted after href links within content
    -   gallery imagery is forced to flex column mode to avoid column collision.

#### From Version 1
-   The submission included six pages
-   The audio file within index.html contains two types of audio files, enhancing compatibility
-   The submission uses multiple tables, lists and external links across numerous pages
-   In location.html, I nest an iframe of embedded google map code within a feature tag
-   Also within location.html are several inline operators and emoji demonstration
-   The contact.html page has several more external links as well as an email link.
